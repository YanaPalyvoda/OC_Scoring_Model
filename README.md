# OC_Scoring_Model

This project was carried out as part of the training of the OC IA engineer.

## Context
The financial company "Prêt à dépenser" offers consumer loans to people with little or no credit history. It is very important to assess the risk of non-repayment of the loan for each loan applicant.

## Goal
The objective of this project is to develop a scoring algorithm to help decide whether a loan can be granted to a client.

## The model goals:
 - calculate the probability that a customer will or will not repay the loan.
 - be easily interpreted by customer relationship managers 
 - provide a measure of the importance of the variables that led the model to give this probability to a customer.

The dataset was provided by OC.
